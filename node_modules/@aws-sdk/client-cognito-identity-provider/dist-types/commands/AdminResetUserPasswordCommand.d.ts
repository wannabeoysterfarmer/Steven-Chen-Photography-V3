/**
 * <p>Resets the specified user's password in a user pool as an administrator. Works on any
 *             user.</p>
 *         <p>When a developer calls this API, the current password is invalidated, so it must be
 *             changed. If a user tries to sign in after the API is called, the app will get a
 *             PasswordResetRequiredException exception back and should direct the user down the flow
 *             to reset the password, which is the same as the forgot password flow. In addition, if
 *             the user pool has phone verification selected and a verified phone number exists for the
 *             user, or if email verification is selected and a verified email exists for the user,
 *             calling this API will also result in sending a message to the end user with the code to
 *             change their password.</p>

 *         <note>
 *             <p>This action might generate an SMS text message. Starting June 1, 2021, U.S.
 *                 telecom carriers require that you register an origination phone number before you can
 *                 send SMS messages to U.S. phone numbers. If you use SMS text messages in Amazon Cognito,
 *                 you must register a phone number with <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/pinpoint/home/">Amazon Pinpoint</a>.
 *                 Cognito  will use the the registered number automatically. Otherwise, Cognito users that must
 *                 receive SMS messages might be unable to sign up, activate their accounts, or sign
 *                 in.</p>
 *             <p>If you have never used SMS text messages with Amazon Cognito or any other Amazon Web Service, Amazon SNS might place your account in SMS sandbox. In <i>
 *                   <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/sns-sms-sandbox.html">sandbox
 *                     mode</a>
 *                </i>, youâ€™ll have limitations, such as sending messages
 *                 to only verified phone numbers. After testing in the sandbox environment, you can
 *                 move out of the SMS sandbox and into production. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-user-identity-pools-sms-userpool-settings.html"> SMS message settings for Cognito User Pools</a> in the <i>Amazon

 * @example
 * Use a bare-bones client and the command you need to make an API call.
 * ```javascript

 * // const { CognitoIdentityProviderClient, AdminResetUserPasswordCommand } = require("@aws-sdk/client-cognito-identity-provider"); // CommonJS import
 * const client = new CognitoIdentityProviderClient(config);
 * const command = new AdminResetUserPasswordCommand(input);
 * const response = await client.send(command);
 * ```
 *
 * @see {@link AdminResetUserPasswordCommandInput} for command's `input` shape.
 * @see {@link AdminResetUserPasswordCommandOutput} for command's `response` shape.
 * @see {@link CognitoIdentityProviderClientResolvedConfig | config} for CognitoIdentityProviderClient's `config` shape.
